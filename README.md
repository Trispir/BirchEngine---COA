SDL2 and CPP - Game Engine - Character and Map

Hello everyone! I have been following a guide on YouTube for creating a game using CPP and SDL2 and have been having a blast. 
I've been working on this project for a couple of weeks now and have learned a ton. However, I will admit I am quite inexperienced so troubleshooting can be especially difficult. 

The problem is that I've come to a point where my code matches the YouTube guide, but I am not getting the expected results when debugging/testing. I have no idea what I changed! 
A couple of nights ago I had my player component on the screen above my map and was moveable. However, since then the player component is no longer visible. 
(it is almost like it is behind the map.. but I don't think that is the case). I could even use by WASD controls in the direction of the collision component and get a console 
print of "Wall Hit" to confirm collision, but the player isn't even visible!!

I have removed keyboard controls as well as collision detection and now I'm just at a loss. I have spent around 8 hours trying to troubleshoot this now and am growing so 
frustrated!  My hope is that I can share with you my project and identify a solution. It will include the assets folder with the character png and SDL2/SDL2 image. 
All you will have to do is initialize the SDL2 and SDL2 image directories inside of Visual Studio for include and lib.. I was using x64.

When I debug, I get no errors only a couple of warnings and I don't think they apply to my situation of not seeing my player component. Please get me out of this jam!! 
I want to keep learning CPP and not give up on this game! 

Thank you so much!
